# Open Learner Modeling

This repository contains the source code for **student modeling**, hosted on this platform: [Open Learner Modeling](https://pankajchejara23.github.io/open-learner-modeling/). It provides a robust implementation of **Bayesian network-based knowledge modeling**, leveraging datasets from the VARA platform to predict and analyze student learning behaviors.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Bayesian Network Modeling**: Advanced techniques for student knowledge estimation.
- **Integration with VARA Platform**: Seamlessly analyze educational data from VARA datasets.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Insightful representations of student learning progress.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Adjust settings to tailor models for different datasets.

## 💡 How It Works

The code implements student modeling using Bayesian networks by:  
- Preprocessing VARA platform datasets.  
- Training a Bayesian network to infer student knowledge.  
- Generating visualizations and reports for better understanding of student progress.
